# AGNT

This is the documentation for the AGNT platform — an AI agent orchestration system with a desktop application and cloud API.
AGNT provides tools for building, managing, and executing AI agents, workflows, goals, and custom tools.
The platform consists of a Remote API (https://api.agnt.gg) for cloud services and a Local Backend API (http://localhost:3333/api) for desktop execution.
Authentication uses JWT tokens via Google OAuth, Magic Link, or API Keys.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](https://agnt.gg/docs/getting-started): Download, install, and set up AGNT for your first project. Covers Windows, macOS, and Linux installers, feature overview, and getting help.

## API Overview

- [API Getting Started](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/getting-started): Quick start guide for the AGNT API. Covers authentication setup, API architecture (Remote vs Local), common request patterns, response formats, rate limiting, and status codes.
- [API Examples & Best Practices](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/examples): Practical code examples for agents, workflows, goals, MCP integration, streaming, error handling, token management, rate limiting, caching, batch operations, and logging.

## Authentication

- [Authentication Guide](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/authentication): Complete authentication reference. Covers Google OAuth, Magic Link, API Key auth, token management, middleware, plan-based authorization, provider registry, connection management, and security best practices.
- [Authentication Examples](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/authentication-examples): Real-world authentication examples from the AGNT codebase. Covers Firecrawl, GitHub, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Slack integrations with AuthManager patterns, error handling, and testing.
- [Authentication Usage Guide](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/authentication-usage-guide): Practical implementation guide for authentication in plugins and tools. Covers standard action templates, conditional auth, multi-provider support, provider-specific examples, testing, and common pitfalls.

## Remote API (api.agnt.gg)

- [Remote API Overview](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/remote-overview): Overview of the cloud-based Remote API. Covers base URL, API categories, common endpoints quick reference, response format, rate limits by plan, CORS, pagination, filtering, webhooks, error codes, and SDK support.
- [Remote API Endpoints](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/remote-endpoints): Complete endpoint reference for the Remote API. Covers Marketplace (browse, publish, install, reviews, analytics), Users & Subscriptions (register, login, profile, billing), Executions, Custom Tools, Content Outputs, Streaming, Email Services, Webhooks, Referrals, Waitlist & Onboarding, and Auth Providers.

## Local API (localhost:3333)

- [Local API Overview](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/local-overview): Overview of the desktop Local Backend API. Covers local execution, system integration, performance, security, API categories, common endpoints quick reference, SSL certificates, file uploads, SSE streaming, health checks, CORS, debugging, and security considerations.
- [Local API Endpoints](https://agnt.gg/docs/api/local-endpoints): Complete endpoint reference for the Local API. Covers Agents (CRUD, chat, streaming), Goals (create, execute, evaluate, golden standards), Orchestrator (universal chat), Workflows (CRUD, start/stop, status), Executions, Tools, Custom Tools, MCP Servers (add, test, capabilities), NPM Search, Models (by provider, categories, cache), Streaming, Speech (Whisper transcription), Users (settings, health), Webhooks, and Tool Schemas.
