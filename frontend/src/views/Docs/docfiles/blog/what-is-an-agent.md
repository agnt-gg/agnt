# What is an Agent?

An agent is your digital employee - think of them as automated team members that can run workflows on your behalf. Just like a human employee, each agent:
- Has specific roles and responsibilities
- Manages their own resources and budget
- Maintains their own knowledge and memory
- Works within defined permissions
- Can be scheduled and assigned tasks

# How Agents Work

Like any good employee, agents are responsible for:

**Task Management**
   - Runs workflows to complete assigned tasks
   - Keeps track of what they're working on
   - Maintains their own schedule
   - Reports on their progress and results

**Resource Management**
   - Manages their own budget (credits)
   - Tracks their resource usage
   - Stays within assigned limits
   - Reports on resource consumption

**Knowledge Management**
   - Maintains memory between tasks
   - Learns from previous executions
   - Keeps track of important information
   - Shares knowledge when collaborating

## Fields Needed for an Agent

- Name
- Description
- Status
- Icon
- Credits Used (progress bar)
- Credit Limit (progress bar)
- Workflows
- Last Active
- Success Rate


# Agent Setup

Just like onboarding a new employee, setting up an agent involves:
- Assigning their roles (which workflows they can run)
- Setting their budget and resource limits
- Providing necessary access and permissions
- Establishing their work schedule
- Setting up their workspace (memory storage)

# Working with Agents

You can interact with agents similar to how you'd work with team members:
1. Assign them specific workflows to manage
2. Set their priorities and schedules
3. Monitor their performance and resource usage
4. Review their work and results
5. Adjust their responsibilities as needed

# What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a structured sequence of steps that accomplishes a specific goal. Key aspects include:
- Pre-defined series of connected tasks that run in a specific order
- Can combine multiple tools and decision points
- Executed by agents to achieve complex automation
- Consumes credits based on the complexity and resources used
- Returns results that can be used for further processing or reporting

# What is a Tool?

A tool is a specialized function that performs a specific task. Tools are:
- Individual building blocks that can be used within workflows
- Self-contained functions with specific inputs and outputs
- Can be combined to create more complex automation
- Consume credits based on their complexity and usage
- Essential components that agents use to accomplish tasks

# What is a Resource?

Resources are the assets and capabilities available to agents:

Data Resources:
- Databases and data sets
- File storage
- API access points
- Configuration settings

Credit Resources:
- System currency used to execute operations
- Consumed when running workflows and tools
- Can be allocated and managed per agent
- Helps control and monitor system usage

# How Everything Connects

The system works together as follows:
1. Agents are your primary automation workers
2. Agents use workflows to accomplish complex tasks
3. Workflows are composed of individual tools
4. Both workflows and tools consume resources (data and credits)
5. Resources are managed and monitored at the agent level
