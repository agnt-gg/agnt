# Features

Too many to list, but here are some of the most important ones.

## Agent Manager (soon)
Create agents and manage their settings.

An agent is ultimately a manager of goals, resources, and processes (workflows). It can create and run workflows as needed to accomplish tasks.

It can create workflows that run just once, or it can create workflows that run on a schedule, or workflows that run when triggered by something external.

Think of an agent as a collection of base directives: 
- Goal Management (user specified goals, and agent will create workflows to accomplish them)
- Resource Management (agent will manage resources, like system credits, files, databases, etc.)
- Process Management (agent will manage workflows, like scheduling, triggering, tools available, etc.)
