# Q1 2025 Development Roadmap

## Our plans for evolving AGNT(H1 2025)

Our project is making significant progress across various fronts. This roadmap outlines our current priorities and future direction for the first half of 2025. Please note that these plans may evolve as the project develops.

The ideas presented here are not set in stone—we may approach these challenges differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is not an exhaustive list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.

We encourage community participation! Each section will link to relevant discussions where you can learn more and contribute your thoughts.

## Remote Cloud Support (80% complete)

Our top priority is enhancing remote cloud support, which is currently 80% complete. Key initiatives include:

- **Login Systems**: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms for remote access.
- **CRUD Operations**: Developing robust Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for cloud-based data management.
- **Engine Integration**: Ensuring seamless integration with various cloud-based engines.
- **Streaming Capabilities**: Implementing efficient data streaming for real-time operations.
- **Webhook Implementation**: Developing a system for event-driven interactions via webhooks.

## Public Registry Systems (70% complete)

We're working on several public registry systems to enhance our ecosystem:

### Public Agent Registry System (20% complete)

- Designing a centralized system for registering and managing agents.
- Implementing search and discovery features for registered agents.
- Developing version control and update mechanisms for agents.

### Public Auth Registry System (70% complete)

- Finalizing the authentication and authorization registry.
- Implementing secure token management and distribution.
- Developing user role and permission management systems.

### Public Tool Registry System (70% complete)

- The public tool registry system is implemented and operational, but needs to be refactored to be api based.
- We're now concentrating on expanding the tool ecosystem and improving integration capabilities.

### Public Workflow Registry System (100% complete)

- **Completed**: Our public workflow registry system is now fully operational.
- We're now focusing on maintenance, performance optimization, and user feedback.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remote Cloud Support**: Finalize the remaining 20% of remote cloud support features, focusing on advanced security measures and performance optimization.
    
2. **Enhance Agent Registry**: Accelerate development of the public agent registry system, aiming to bring it from 20% to at least 60% completion by the end of the year.
    
3. **Finalize Auth Registry**: Complete the remaining 30% of the public auth registry system, with a focus on advanced security features and scalability.
    
4. **Integrate Systems**: Work on seamless integration between all registry systems and remote cloud support to create a cohesive ecosystem.
    
5. **Community Engagement**: Increase efforts to gather user feedback and encourage community contributions, particularly for the newly completed workflow and tool registry systems.
    
6. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Develop comprehensive documentation and tutorials for all completed systems to facilitate easier adoption and usage.
